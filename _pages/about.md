I am an Assistant Professor (RTDa) at Dipartimento Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria of Politecnico di Milano (Italy).

My research interests fall in the broad spectrum of **system architecture** field where achieving high-performance and energy-efficiency is paramount.
Specifically major topics: (co-)design of **domain-specific systems**, architectures or frameworks that span the system stack (from the HDL design to the design automation, from the abstraction layer the compilation framework), reconfigurable architectures, especially **FPGAs**, **heterogeneous systems**. 
I am also started investigating _neuromorphic systems_ and _aerospace systems_ where specilization and efficiency are mandatory.

An experiment to better visualize my research can be found [here]() (WIP). 
Further details of my publications can be found in [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y0VnEtkAAAAJ), my [publications page](/publications/), or this [self-made pdf list](\href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavideConficconi/davideconficconi.github.io/master/assets/pdf/publist_dc.pdf) (possibly outdated), or other research profiles in this page.
